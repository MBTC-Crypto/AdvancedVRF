As we already know, the encryption and decryption processes is done by using a key. This block cipher uses a key that is 128 bits long for encryption and decryption of a message and is the least secure of the three blocks available.

The AES-192 uses a key that is 192 bits long for the encryption and decryption of messages. It is more resistant to brute-force attacks as compared to AES-128 because it has a longer key, thereby more secure. Despite this, AES-192 is not commonly used, people tend to lean towards AES-256.

The AES-256 uses a key that is 256 bits long for the encryption and decryption of messages. This block is more secure when compared to the AES-128 and AES-192 because of the long length of the encryption key.The longer the encryption key, the more difficult the algorithm is to hack. AES-256 is therefore very resistant to brute-force attacks when compared to the two previous blocks.

AES being an asymmetric block cipher, means that the key used in encryption and decryption is a kept secret and is only made known to the sender and the recipient of the message.

The key used when encrypting the message is usually the same key used to decrypt the message on the receiving end. When encrypting using AES, a person can either use AES-128, AES-192, or even the AES-256. During this encryption, some steps are followed to encrypt a message and these steps are done in rounds.

Each round is made up of several steps of substitution, transposition, and mixing of the message into ciphertext and also has a key called a round key.
